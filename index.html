            <!-- I am puting this section here because I plan to write a small piece about my latest single  -->
            <p>WILLEM's debut single describes the grieving of lost friends and family. Putting a modern twist on 80's drums and synths the song lulls us into a peaceful yet unforgettable groove. As the world around us falls apart we find ourselves dancing in the rain. For a moment it feels like everything might just turn out okay</p>

                <p>The first project that WILLEM takes us through his highschool years. It details the adventures he had throughout San Francisco and his hometown of Oakland. Trying to escape his demons through drugs, girls and music.</p>

                <p>After <em>Days Without Consequence</em>. WILLEM takes year to experiment and develop new sounds. The Songs in the <em>Dilute My Vision</em> playlist exemplify this and give a hint of the genre-blending artist that he later develops into. The songs range in inspiration from Prince to Mac Demarco. The songs take a break from WILLEM's previously paniful lyrics and show a more passionate and cheerful side of his personality.</p>

                <p>
                Continuing his experimentation with indie rock, WILLEM writes existential lyrics about the state of the world and its affect on his relationships. The third track <em>Internal Dialect</em> is WILLEM showing his strengths as a musician and composer through writing a gentle yet creepy jazz balad.
